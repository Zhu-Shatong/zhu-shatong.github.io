I am a fourth-year B.Eng student in Data Science at the School of Computer Science, [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), adviced by [Junqiao Zhao](http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~junqiao/). I have been honored with National Scholarship twice.

**Research Interests:** I have a broad interest in advancing the next generation of artificial intelligence, with a primary focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and robotic manipulation. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the Tongji TiEV Lab, where I explore the generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation through offline meta-reinforcement learning.

**Data Science:** As a Data Science student, I am passionate about applying mathematical techniques to solve real-world challenges, particularly in areas such as data analysis, data mining, and operations research.

**Previously:** I have interned as an algorithm engineer at [Meetsocial](https://en.meetsocial.com/) and [ZhongAn Insurance](https://www.zhongan.com/). Additionally, I have contributed to research on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) as a Research Assistant at the Tongji TiEV Lab, and worked on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLM) at the Tongji FinLab.
